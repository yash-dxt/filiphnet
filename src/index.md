# yash dixit ðŸ¥‘

hey, this is yash and i like to do random stuff.

these days i'm travelling a lot, sorta writing a book about the awesome food we have in india & running a clothing brand.

i would like to create some apps in the near future that people love to use.

before this i used to be a software developer at mulitple startups. post that, i founded a clothing brand called above minimum (it did around 4000 orders, and over â‚¹50l in revenue) before i closed it down & started another brand.

also, i waited for 5-6 years before i purchased this domain as it was unavailable and now it seems like my life is complete. i think life all comes down to if you own the .com domain of your full name. 

this is inspired by [filiph hrachek's website](https://filiph.net/).
